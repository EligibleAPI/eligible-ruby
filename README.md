# Official Ruby client for Eligible API has moved!

Hello,

If you are looking for the official Ruby client for Eligible.com API, the project has moved to a new place now.

You have the following options for including the client into your project:

1. Preferred option: Use officially released Rubygems version by adding the following line into your `Gemfile.lock` file:

    ```ruby
    gem 'eligible'
    ```

2. Development version: Use unreleased development version of the gem from the new Github repository:

    ```ruby
    gem 'eligible', git: "https://github.com/eligible/eligible-ruby.git"
    ```

Should you have any questions about the change, please contact our support team at support@eligible.com.
